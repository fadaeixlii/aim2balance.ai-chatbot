# The aim2balance.ai Concept

This document outlines the core concept of the aim2balance.ai project, which aims to connect AI usage to tangible environmental restoration.

## Core Mission

The fundamental goal is to create a system that tracks the environmental footprint of AI usage and translates it into a financial contribution towards ecosystem restoration. This creates a cycle where the growth of AI directly supports planetary health.

## The Impact-to-Restoration Model

The model can be broken down into four key steps:

1.  **Track AI Usage:** The system will monitor key metrics of AI interaction, with the primary metric being the number of tokens used in both requests and responses for each client.

2.  **Estimate Environmental Impact:** The tracked usage data is then used to estimate the environmental resources consumed. The initial focus is on:
    *   **Energy Consumption:** Measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
    *   **Water Consumption:** Measured in liters (L).

3.  **Calculate the "m² Restored" Metric:** This is the central, user-facing metric. The estimated energy and water consumption is converted into a single, understandable unit: **square meters (m²) of ecosystem restored**. This provides a tangible and relatable measure of the user's environmental impact and their potential to offset it.

4.  **Invoice for Restoration:** At the end of a billing cycle (e.g., monthly), clients receive an invoice based on the total "m² restored" that corresponds to their AI usage. The payment from the client is then directed to verified ecosystem restoration projects.

## User Experience and Tiers

The system will present different views based on the user's payment status:

-   **Non-Payer View:** This view will show the user's "restoration potential." It will display the total m² that *could* be restored if they were to activate a paid plan, encouraging them to contribute.

-   **Payer View:** For paying clients, this view will provide a dashboard showing the total m² that *has been* restored thanks to their contributions. It can include breakdowns and visualizations of their positive impact over time.

## Implementation Goal

The objective is to integrate this model into the rebranded LibreChat application. This will involve creating a new module that can accurately track token usage per client, perform the necessary calculations, and present the data through a user-friendly interface, all while handling the billing and invoicing process.
