## 3. Conclusion

The `@librechat/client` package is well-structured and follows modern frontend development practices. Its clear separation of concerns makes it easy to extend and maintain. When building new features for aim2balance.ai, this package should be the first place to look for existing components and hooks to reuse. Any new, highly reusable components should be added to this package to maintain a clean and modular codebase.
